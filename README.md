What is it:
- This software is perfect for automatically linking Steam Guard to your accounts and creating mafiles.

Installation:

To configure it, you need to specify your data in the Settings.json file.

All the settings are intuitive, but just in case, I have described everything below.

- Mode - Mode of operation. Accepts one of two values TXT or EXCEL
- MailProtocol - IMAP or POP3.
- UseSSL - If your mail server does not have an SSL certificate, set false, otherwise true.

Limits:
- Steam gives 4 attempts per week to link the Steam Guard???
